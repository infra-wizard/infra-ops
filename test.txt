We are configuring a Windows machine as a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions. The runner communicates with GitHubâ€™s API endpoints to:

Register and authenticate the runner with the GitHub repository/organization.

Download workflow definitions (YAML files) and related metadata from GitHub.

Fetch source code from GitHub repositories during workflow execution.

Send job status, logs, and artifacts back to GitHub Actions for tracking and visibility in the GitHub UI.
